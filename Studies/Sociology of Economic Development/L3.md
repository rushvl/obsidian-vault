# Modernization School of Thought

1. **Rise of USA as a superpower, while Western Europe was weakened by the second world war.** The USA became a world leader and practically took over the responsibility of managing the affairs of the whole world in 1950 with the implementation of the Martial Plan.
2. The spread of the **United world communist movement**. During this time the soviet union extended its influence not only to Eastern Europe but also to a large part of Asia like in China and Korea.
3.  The **disintegration of European colonial empires** in places like Asia, Africa, Australia and Latin America, giving birth to many new nation states in the third world.
