## Global Risks Report

### Projections

1. Risk to economic stability
	- Most of the economic pressures would be leading to increasing risk of economic stagnation.
	- A challenging economic climate would persist if the local levels of the government are not able to take decisive actions on the required social support needed to confront the key risks faced by vulnerable people.
2. Climate change is striking harder and the last 5 years have the been the warmest.
	- Natural disasters are becoming more intense and more frequent and global temperatures are on track to increase by at least 3% towards the end of the century.
3. Better dialogues and transformative actions are required to upscale community capabilities and eradicate situations of vulnerable living.
4. Health systems under new pressures
	- Climate crises are leading to newer vulnerabilities resulting in changing from social to environmental, demographical technological patterns.
	- Non communicable diseases as well as infectious diseases are found to be the leading cause of death as the existing health risks surge and newer ones emerge.
	- Coordinated multi stakeholder action is needed to build resilience across communities.
